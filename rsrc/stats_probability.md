### Statistics and Probability 
- Counting, Permutations, Combinations [Link](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability/counting-permutations-and-combinations/)
  - Permutations = n!/(n-r)! ; n is total number of objects and r is number of objects selected
  - Combinations = n!/{r!.(n-r)!} ; n is total number of objects and r is number of objects selected
  - Rule of product (src: wikipedia): In combinatorics, the rule of product or multiplication principle is a basic counting principle (a.k.a. the fundamental principle of counting). Stated simply, it is the intuitive idea that if there are a ways of doing something and b ways of doing another thing, then there are a Â· b ways of performing both actions. Example for first slot 5 options, for secod and third also 5. So there are total 5x5x5 ways of considering alll combinations. 
- Random variable [Link](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/ap-statistics/random-variables-ap/discrete-random-variables/)
  - discrete R.V is for counting; continous R.V is for measuring.
  - X: Number of heads after tossing a coing 3 times or Y measuring the rain fall in inches. 
  - pdf: probability/number of heads(0,1,2,3) ; P(Y between 1.9 and 2.1 inches of rain)

  - Random Variables
  - Probability Distribution
  - Expectation of random variables E(X)   
  - Define: As the number of identically distributed, randomly generated variables increases, their sample mean (average) approaches their theoretical mean
- Descriptive Statistics
  - Sample Distribution [Link](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/ap-statistics/sampling-distribution-ap/what-is-sampling-distribution/v/introduction-to-sampling-distributions)
    - Population parameters (population mean, std, proportions) etc.
    - Take a random sample from this distribution  (sample mean, std dev etc)
    - Central limit theorem (as you take multiple samples more like infinite samples). Samples grows, plot it on frequency distribution y-axis freuency and x-axis sample means. It converges to normal distribution. It applies to means, sums and variance. 
    - This later becomes sampling distribution of sample mean or any statistics.
